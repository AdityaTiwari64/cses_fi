🎯 What is CSES?
The CSES Problem Set is a collection of competitive programming practice problems. It contains a comprehensive set of problems covering various algorithms and data structures, making it perfect for:

🏆 Competitive Programming preparation
💼 Technical Interview practice
🧠 Algorithm & Data Structure mastery
🎓 Computer Science skill development

📈 Daily Commitment
cppclass ProblemSolver {
private:
    string goal = "Solve at least 1 CSES problem daily";
    int currentStreak = 0;
    bool consistency = true;
    
public:
    void dailyPractice() {
        solveProblem();
        updateProgress();
        pushToGitHub();
        currentStreak++;
    }
};
